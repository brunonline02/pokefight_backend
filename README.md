# pokefight_backend

Welcome to the backend repository for the turn-based Pokemon game inspired by the Gameboy games! This backend was built using Node.js and Express, and it serves as the server for the game while the frontend is handled by the companion project at https://github.com/brunonline02/pokefight_frontend.

### Getting Started

To get started with the backend, clone this repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. You can then run the server locally using npm start. The server should be available at http://localhost:3000/.

The backend provides a REST API for the frontend to communicate with. Endpoints include /pokemon for retrieving all Pokemon and /:id for handling the logic of the battles.

We hope you enjoy playing this turn-based Pokemon game! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on this repository.
